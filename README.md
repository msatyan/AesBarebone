# Simple AES demo with a barebone AES C language source code. 

This is a C language source program to demo the fundamental use of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This sample code encrypts and decrypts a single AES block of data by using AES218. The AES source code used in this is C language AES source code extracted from the latest OpenSSL library(openssl-1.1.0c.tar.gz).  

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. AES became effective as a USA federal government standard on May 26, 2002.  

The AES is based on Rijndael algorithm (uses block ciphers) submitted by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen to NIST and selected to be the new AES (The choice was announced in October 2000). For AES, NIST selected three members of the Rijndael family, each with a block size of 128 bits, but three different key lengths: 128, 192 and 256 bits.
